## About The Project

### Project Description

As a developer, you start to do research on the impact, the good and the bad, that social media has on society. Based on this research and also the impact that Covid-19 had on the usage of social media platforms, you recognised the need for a platform where people can share and connect with each other, safely and securely.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

#### Hardware requirements :

You need a Intel based Mac for learning and developing apps using Swift programming language.

* Intel based Mac Mini, MacBooks or iMacs

* RAM : 4gb or more

#### Software requirements :

* iOS 14.1 or later

* Swift 5.0 or later
  ```sh
  https://swift.org/download/
  ```

* Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavaricks or later)

* Xcode 11.0 or later
  ```sh
  https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
  ```
  
#### Programing languages that one must know :

* It would be great if you know a object oriented language like C++, Objective-C or Javascript.

### Installation
Here are a couple of ways to clone this repo:

1. Go to Source Control in Xcode and select Projectname -- master, then Configure...
2. Configure your Xcode Git project settings.
3. Select Remotes, then select the plus icon and choose Add Remote...
4. In the Address field, paste the Git clone URL for your repo copied in the previous step. Select Add Remote, then select Done to finish creating the origin remote for your local Git repo.
5. Add a remote to the local Git repo for your Xcode project to connect to Bookarazzi.
6. Go to Source Control, Push..., enter the branchname on origin to push to, and select Push.
7. Push your Xcode project to Bookarazzi.
8. Xcode will push your project to your Bookarazzi Git repo.

#### Installation UIColour

You can use [UIColour](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor) to install `UIColour` by adding the proper description to your `ColourPalette.swift` file:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0
import SwiftUI

func hexStringToUIColor (hex:String) -> UIColor {
    var cString:String = hex.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines).uppercased()

    if (cString.hasPrefix("#")) {
        cString.remove(at: cString.startIndex)
    }

    if ((cString.count) != 6) {
        return UIColor.gray
    }

    var rgbValue:UInt64 = 0
    Scanner(string: cString).scanHexInt64(&rgbValue)

    return UIColor(
        red: CGFloat((rgbValue & 0xFF0000) >> 16) / 255.0,
        green: CGFloat((rgbValue & 0x00FF00) >> 8) / 255.0,
        blue: CGFloat(rgbValue & 0x0000FF) / 255.0,
        alpha: CGFloat(1.0)
    )
}
```
Then run `swift build` whenever you get prepared.

#### Installation: Authenticate a new user

You can use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to install `Authenticate a new user` by adding the following to your file:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0
Auth.auth().addStateDidChangeListener { (auth, user) in
  if let user = user {
    let email = user.email
    // ...
  }
}
Auth.auth().signIn(withEmail: userEmail, password: password) { (user, error) in
  if let user = user {
    // ...
  }
}
```
Then run `swift build` whenever you get prepared.

### Peer Review Feedback

#### Peer 1:
1. I like the aesthetic of the application and the animation affects.
2. The color scheme goes well with the social app concept and the feelings it convey.
3. The authentication views looks nice and is simple and easy to use.
4. Feeds view looks nice and simple.
5. I like the layout and aesthetic of the profile view.
6. Posting functionality works efficiently.
7. Back button in most views could change so that it is not always there, maybe change the color of the button to suit the color scheme.
8. I have no complaints about the aesthetic of the app.
9. I would most likely download it and try it out.

#### Peer 2:
1. The application feature set is impressive.
2. Really unique application.
3. The theme is unique, along with the colour palette is super cool.
4. The iconography assists into navigation the authentication views and the login and sign up buttons are clear and easy to use.
5. Just display the username as well in the feeds view, and some styling updates.
6. With the bottom navigation it is easy to access the profile page.
7. Super intuitive, really easy to use, maybe add validation if the upload image is empty or caption is empty.
8. The constant back button is a bit confusing, and make it more clear on each page what the page is with like a heading title of the page maybe?
9. Really cute minimal colour palette, maybe just check the contrast of the buttons and text versus the background.
10. The feature set definitely is why I would download the app
11. Just UI Updates and spacing corrections, but other than that well done Jeandre! Really cool app.

#### Peer 3:
1. The app is really nice and the flow on the onboarding and login/register works well. 
2. A book club app is a very interesting theme. 
3. The user was able to login and register on the authentication view.
4. The news feed is nice and simple and easy to understand. The images and cards are a nice size. 
5. The post/images at the bottom of the profile view needs to be adjusted for size and spacing.
6. Works well
7. User can create a post.
8. Very functional.
9. The navigation could be fixed. i don't understand the back button to the login screen.
10. Clean, simple, pretty
11. Yes I would like to share my reading with other like minded people.
12. Splash screen, app logo, book categories look nice, keep up the good work :)

#### Peer 4:
1. The application is fun and bright, I like it.
2. I was unsure of what the theme was but overall the theme is consistent throughout the app.
3. Easy to use and understand, also very cool animation to swap between login and signup.
4. The posts need to include who posted the post and how many likes it has, but otherwise still usable.
5. The profile has everything you need to see, and it is clear.
6. Works well.
7. A little bit strange that the back button logs you out but otherwise very straight forward.
8. Look cute and bright, a few elements that can be refined but otherwise good.
9. The application looks good and fun to use.
10. A few refinements here and there, like a proper logout button and posts including the like count and who posted it.

#### Peer 5:
1. I like the colours and the user-flow is intuitive. 
2. I cannot think of another social media app with a similar thing.
3. The layout is clear, I can see where I need to input my information and click login.
4. It works as it should, but the titles of posts need to be changed from the firestore ID.
5. The information is clear but there needs to be options to change profile info.
6. I don't think it was demonstrated but the feed was clearly made from posts added to firestore.
7. It made sense but the back button shouldn't always appear.
8. I liked the colours a lot, but some spacing issues were there.
9. It's a personal answer, but I am trying to avoid social media.
10. Just ui and functionality polish.

## Conclusion

<p align="center">
  In this project I tried to created a new and exciting social media platform using Xcode, Swift and Firebase. Although my application did consist of a splash screen, a social feed screen of posts made by users, the ability to make a new post, a user screen, and a profile screen, the overall success of the app was not met.

I struggle once again, as in previous projects implementing Firebase, with the functionality and the storing and displaying of information, as required by the brief. This is very disappointing as I thoroughly enjoyed the concept and ideation of my app, but did not manage to incorporate all the elements that I set out to do.

In my next project I will strive to understand the brief and context of the app in more detail to achieve a successfull project.
